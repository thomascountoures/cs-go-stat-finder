# CSGO Trackify by Thomas Countoures
A small web app built with AngularJS, Express, Node.js and previously, MongoDB. Type a user name or steam ID into the search bar to get user statistics. I will continue add more to this app.


# Instructions (Updated) - November 25, 2015

EDIT: I've removed the need to install or use MongoDB, as persistent storage isn't necessary for this. The recent players are now saved in the Player Service through Angular on the client side.

Please clone repo and do the following:

* Go to root folder with package.json file.

`npm install`

* Enter your Steam API key on line 5 of routes.js

* Run node server through node or grunt from the command line.

`node server.js` or simply `grunt`

* Go to port 8000 of your localhost.

`http://localhost:8000/`
